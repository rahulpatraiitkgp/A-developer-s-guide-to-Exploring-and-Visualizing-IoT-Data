## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for Course [A developer's guide to Exploring and Visualizing IoT Data ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploring-visualizing-iot-data).

## Please Read:

As a CS minor student of IIT Kharagpur and a long-time self-taught learner, I have completed many CS related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and Edx. I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. Here I released these solutions, which are **only for your reference purpose**. It may help you to save some time. And I hope you don't copy any part of the code (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully), see the quiz solutions before you start your own adventure. This course is almost the simplest IoT Data Learning course I have ever taken, but the simplicity is based on the fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure given by IBM team.
